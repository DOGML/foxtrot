# `cdt`
`cdt` is a library for calculating
[Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) and
[constrained Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation)
triangulations.

It is optimized for correctness and speed, using exact predicates to perform
point-in-circle and orientation tests.
