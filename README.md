# Foxtrot
_A fast STEP file viewer_

## Subsystems
- `cdt`: Constrained Delaunay triangulation (standalone)
- `express`: Parser for EXPRESS schemas files and a matching code generation
  system
- `experiments`: Experiments with trait systems (unused)
- `step`: Auto-generated STEP file parser.  This take a _very_ long time to
  compile, so it is isolated into this crate.
- `triangulate`: Converts a file loaded by `step` into a triangle mesh, using
  `cdt` as its core
- `nurbs`: A handful of NURBS / B-spline algorithms used by `triangulate`
- `gui`: GUI for rendering STEP files

## Code generation
`step/src/ap214.rs` is automatically generated from
`10303-214e3-aim-long.exp`, which is available via [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) [here](http://www.steptools.com/stds/help/cvshowto.html)
(check out the `APs` folder).

To regenerate, run
```
cargo run --release --example gen_exp -- path/to/APs/10303-214e3-aim-long.exp step/src/ap214.rs
```
