## Code generation
`step2/src/ap214_.rs` is automatically generated from
`10303-214e3-aim-long.exp`, which is available via [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) [here](http://www.steptools.com/stds/help/cvshowto.html)
(check out the `APs` folder).

To regenerate, run
```
cargo run --release --example gen_exp -- path/to/APs/10303-214e3-aim-long.exp step2/src/ap214.rs
